Settings for Advanced Users

The values set in settings.m are the
values that these settings will use when
RSDFT is first started up.

--Precondition CG: Control whether or not
preconditioning is used.

--Use Adpative Scheme: Controls whether
or not certain perameters are changed during
execution.  This is mainly used to speedup
execution, but this speed up has two potential
downsides.  The first is that the final eigenvalues 
are slightly different and that under the wrong
conditions, execution might take longer so use this
option with care.

--Enable Charge Density Visualization: Controls
whether a visualization of the molecule's charge
density is shown after execution is completed.

--Diagonalization Method: Use drop-down menu
to select which diagonalization method(s) are
used.
0 --> Lanczos 1st step and chebyshev filtering thereafter
1 --> Lanczos all the time
2 --> Full-Chebyshev subspace iteration first step
      chebyshev filtering thereafter.


--Polynomial Degree for Chebyshev filtering:
Used to specify the degree of the Chebyshev
polynomial.  10 is a good mix of speed and
accuracy.
